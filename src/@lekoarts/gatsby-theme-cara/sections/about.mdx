## About Me

> AWS Certified Cloud Practioner Instructor and Full-Stack Developer (MERN)

I am a veteran of the United States Air Force with a Bachelors in Communication Studies from Temple University, Japan Campus.  After living abroad with the Military and my university I returned after almost 14 years to restart my code and IT career.  I have since attended a year long program where we learned the LAMP and MERN stacks as well as AWS.  I have been teaching the MERN stack since January 2019 and AWS Cloud Foundations since July 2019.  Currently I am studying to achieve my AWS Cloud Architect Associates level.
